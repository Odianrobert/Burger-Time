# Burger-Time

Burger-Time! is a burger logger/restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. It was created with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars, and a homemade ORM. Node and MySql were used to query and route data, and Handlebars was utilized to generate HTML.

HOW TO USE:

Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured
Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page
The app will store every burger in the database, whether devoured or not
